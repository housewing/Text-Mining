I implement navie bayers algorithm by myself 

And tf_matrix like:

file ******************************
0    * 0 0 0 4 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0...
1    * 0
2    * 1
3    * 0
4    * 0       
5    * 0
6    * 0
7    * 0
8    * 0
9    * 9
10   * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

row means file with term frequency
col means key word

probability_matrix also like previous figure, but only have seven rows
